Abstract – Hydropower, utilized for centuries, is promoted globally as renewable energy. The many
ecological costs associated with hydropower facilities can be mitigated, but the perceived socio-economic
beneﬁts often outweigh environmental concern. The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), implemented
in 2000, established a framework for community action in the ﬁeld of water policy. It constitutes an
instrument to compel hydropower facilities to align with environmental requirements. Based on the WFD
and national law, a National Plan for Modern Environmental Conditions for Hydropower (NAP) was
formulated in Sweden to renegotiate the environmental permits of around 2000 hydropower plants and
dams. The NAP process commenced in 2022 and is estimated to last approximately 20 year. In this review,
we assessed the 33 court cases completed until the end of 2024, out of which 22 resulted in permit
withdrawal and dam removal, while 11 received decisions requiring remedial measures. The primary focus
of remedial measures was re-establishing longitudinal connectivity; other environmental aspects received
less attention, and monitoring requirements were almost non-existent. We recommend measures using
adaptive design, prioritizing functionality, and monitoring over detailed technical speciﬁcations. In addition,
greater attention should be given also to aquatic habitats in affected reaches: addressing e.g., ﬂow, water
levels, and temperature. In conclusion, this nation-wide process provides a unique opportunity to implement
measures that could beneﬁt entire riverine ecosystems.

1 Introduction
Hydropower facilities and their associated dams and
reservoirs have contributed energy to human society for
centuries, initially on a local scale in the form of e.g., mills and
later at much larger scales after the development of
hydroelectric plants (Almeida et al., 2022). Hydroelectricity
is globally promoted as a renewable resource, but ecological
costs are often high (He et al., 2024; Nyqvist et al., 2025).
Impoundments upstream of dams turn river rapids into lake-
like environments and downstream sections have altered ﬂow-
sedimentation- and physico-chemical dynamics impacting the
river ecosystems (He et al., 2024). For mobile organisms like
ﬁshes, dams block up- and downstream movements, in effect
fragmenting
both
habitats
and
populations,
leading
to
population decline or even local extinction of migratory
species (Jonsson et al., 1999; Limburg and Waldman, 2009,
Algera et al., 2020; Nyqvist et al., 2025). Importantly, similar
issues can apply to relatively resident species, which need to
move in relation to changed environmental conditions and
disperse to maintain genetic diversity (Jones et al., 2021;
Schiavon et al., 2024). On a global scale, dams are considered
to be a threat to almost 4000 aquatic, semi-aquatic, and
terrestrial species (He et al., 2024). Avariety of measures have
been implemented to mitigate the ecological effects of
hydropower. This includes various ﬁsh passage solutions
(Katopodis and Williams, 2012; Silva et al., 2018) which
initially were focused mainly on aiding upstream passage of
salmonids, but later also cover two-way passage of whole ﬁsh
communities (Mallen-Cooper, 1999; Calles et al., 2013a).
Other measures relate to ﬂow regulation effects, which can be
mitigated by implementing multifaceted natural ﬂow variabil-
ity (environmental ﬂows, or “e-ﬂow”) (Richter et al., 1997;
Poff et al., 2010; Acreman et al., 2014). A main concern
related to environmental ﬂow is lost power production, but

models indicate that the annual loss need not be substantial
(Widén et al., 2022b), although regulatory capacity might be
reduced. In practice, however, regulation on minimum ﬂow is
more commonly applied than environmental ﬂows (Arthington
et al., 2006; Malm Renöfält et al., 2010), despite the riverine
ecosystems’ dependence on natural and seasonal variation in
ﬂow magnitude, rate of change, frequency, duration, and
timing (Poff et al., 2010; Acreman et al., 2014). For
temperature- oxygen- and gas supersaturation effects, remedial
measures are available but seldom implemented (Poole and
Berman, 2001; Li et al., 2022). Relating to all mitigation
measures at hand, monitoring and evaluation of the applied
measures in combination with adaptive management based on
such
evaluations
is
required
for
successful
mitigation
performance (Birnie-Gauvin et al., 2017; Nyqvist et al., 2017).
In Sweden, the usage of water for energy generation dates
back many centuries, supplying e.g., mills, triphammers, and
saws through waterwheels, often fed from small dams (Fryxell
et al., 1931; Swedish National Heritage Board, 2021). The ﬁrst
Swedish hydroelectric plant was constructed in 1882; a small-
scale private plant at Rydal in the river Viskan (Perers et al.,
2007). A quick expansion of private and municipal hydro-
power plants followed in the late 1800’s and early 1900’s
(Fryxell et al., 1931). Large-scale production plants were
inaugurated in the 1910’s at the advent of state-owned
hydropower (Olidan in the river Göta älv in 1910, Porjus in the
river Luleälven in 1915, and Älvkarleby in the river Dalälven in
1917, Fryxell et al., 1931; Ödmann et al., 1982; Perers et al.,
2007). The main construction period lasted between 1910 and
1970’s, with a culmination from 1940’s to 1960’s in
association with the development of the national power grid
which made production in the north accessible to the rest of the
country (Ödmann et al., 1982; Perers et al., 2007; Lindström
and Ruud, 2017). Construction levelled off when the potential
for further large-scale development became limited without
causing deterioration to the last few free-ﬂowing large rivers,
with associated critique from environmentalists (Arheimer and
Lindström, 2014; Köhler and Ruud, 2019). This hydroelectric
development has resulted in a present-day state where Sweden
has around 2000 dams associated to hydroelectricity produc-
tion (Lindblom and Holmgren, 2016).
Historically, the perceived socio-economic beneﬁts of
increased
energy
production
outweighed
environmental
concern, which is reﬂected in the existent (legally bound)
operational permits, or the lack thereof in some cases (Ödmann
et al., 1982; Lindström and Ruud, 2017; Schäfer, 2021).
Indeed, hydropower plants often operate under original
permits that have remained valid without re-evaluation under
modern environmental laws (Svensson, 2000). Consequently,
in Sweden, hydroelectric production has historically faced
fewer environmental mitigation requirements than other
industries (Schäfer, 2021). Even if some history writers have
claimed that no serious criticism was raised against the
negative environmental effects until the mid-1900’s (Ödmann
et al., 1982; Jakobsson, 2002), this perspective likely
overlooks silent or silenced opposition to river regulation; not
the least the experiences and opinions of the indigenous Sámi,
whoenduredlandappropriation,forcedrelocations,lossofwater
access, destruction of reindeer grazing lands, and other major
environmental changes in their homelands associated to with
early large-scale hydropower development (Össbo, 2023a, b).
In 2019, Swedish environmental law was updated to
require hydroelectric plants to comply with modern environ-
mental legislation (SFS 1998:808, chapter 11, xx27-28,
updated by SFS 2018:1407). Importantly, the EU Water
Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) was implemented in 2000,
which established a framework for community action in the
ﬁeld of water policy. Based on this directive, and the legal
update, the Swedish government tasked the Swedish Agency
for Marine and Water Management (SwAM), the Swedish
Energy Agency, and Svenska Kraftnät (the authority responsi-
ble for Sweden’s electricity transmission system) with
coordinating efforts to modernize environmental conditions
of hydropower facilities (SwAM et al., 2019). A National Plan
for Modern Environmental Conditions for Hydropower (NAP)
was later formulated to renegotiate the environmental permits
of all hydropower facilities with permits older than 40 yr
(Swedish
Government,
M2019/01769).
This
large-scale
process, covering almost all of Sweden’s hydropower plants
and dams, was decided upon by the government in 2020 and
commenced in 2022 and is estimated to take approximately
20 yr. It involves re-licensing each plant through Environmen-
tal Court negotiations, preceded by a collaborative process
including powerplant owners, authorities and interest groups,
to align with current national and EU legislation. To safeguard
electricity production and grid balance, key facilities will face
less stringent requirements (Swedish Government, M2019/
01769). Operators who ﬁnd modernization too costly may
choose to cease operations and remove associated dams
(Swedish Government, M2019/01769). The NAP work has,
however, not progressed undisturbed. In December 2022, the
Ministry of Environment decided to pause the process,
initiating a 12-month suspension on January 30, 2023
(Ministry of Environment, M2022/02251). The Ministry of
Climate and Enterprise has since then extended the pause
several times, with the latest extension lasting until July 1,
2025 (SFS 2024:285), and the process was restarted in August
2025. Due to Sweden’s non-compliance with the Water
Framework Directive, the European Commission launched an
infringement procedure in December 2024, issuing a formal
notice [INFR(2024)2236]. The NAP process hence constitutes
an exceptional case study where energy production needs are
weighted against environmental protection via national and
international environmental law and directives.
Fewer than 40 re-licensing court trials had been completed
within the NAP process until the end of 2024. Nonetheless,
several issues have already emerged, including conﬂicts
between electricity production and environmental consider-
ations, fairness in trials, and uncertainties around water-body
deﬁnitions and classiﬁcation, ensuring best-practice measures,
and monitoring of functionality and effects of prescribed
measures (e.g., County Administrative Boards, 2022; Lenvin,
2022; Government Ofﬁces of Sweden, 2024; Pettersson and
Bladh, 2024; Sandberg, 2024). This underscores the signiﬁcant
need for information and knowledge ahead of the remaining
retrials. Here we evaluate the court verdicts completed so far,
focusing on those with legally binding requirements for
remedial measures. We summarize the listed measures
and monitoring obligations, with particular attention to the
European eel, Anguilla anguilla, given the high importance of
up-and downstream connectivity for this species, and since it is
critically endangered (Pike et al., 2020). Gaps in the

requirements are identiﬁed, and we provide recommendations
for measures and monitoring to be included in future retrials.
2 Review of court decisions
2.1 Data extraction
In Sweden, all court decisions are public due to the
principle of public access to information (SFS 2009:400;
Riksdag of Sweden, 2009). The court decisions on the re-
licensing of the environmental legal conditions for hydropow-
er plants can hence be requested and accessed by anyone. We
identiﬁed completed retrials via the web application “Ström-
men”, provided by the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water
Management (SwAM, 2024). For the 33 retrials that had been
completed until the end of 2024 (i.e., before the onset of the
pause, only counting decisions that cannot be overruled, in
Swedish: har vunnit laga kraft), the court decisions were
obtained by requesting them from the respective courts. The
decisions were requested and received via email in Portable
Document Format (.pdf). From Strömmen, the following
information was extracted: name of hydropower facility, river,
court case number (if applicable supreme court number), court
name, decision (retraction of permission – i.e., removal of
facility, or granted to continue with modern environmental
conditions). From the court verdicts and related discussion in
the document, the following information was extracted:
capacity of the hydropower plant (Q), hydropower plant
effect/power (in kilowatt, kW), mean annual ﬂow of the river
(MQ), mean low ﬂow of the river (MLQ), upstream passage
solutions, downstream passage solutions, requirements con-
cerning type of guidance, maximum angle of rack (in cases
where the type of guidance was an inclined [alfa rack] or
angled [beta rack]; Harbicht et al., 2022), maximum gap width
of rack (in cases where the type of guidance was an inclined or
angled rack), discharge through downstream bypass, eel ramps
(yes/no), type of ﬁshway, required slope of ﬁshway, ﬂow in
ﬁshway, hydropeaking restrictions, e-ﬂow requirements, and
monitoring requirements. To obtain speciﬁc data related to the
European eel, the words “ål”, “ålen” and “ålyngel” (i.e., eel,
the eel and eel elvers in Swedish) was searched for in the court
verdicts. In what context eel was mentioned was noted, and
other relevant comments in relation to context were also noted.
Information on measures and monitoring was extracted from
the court verdicts or the comments on the court verdicts, and,
while sometimes complemented by information provided
elsewhere, the discussions leading to the verdict were not taken
into account.
Of the 33 completed cases, 22 resulted in permit
withdrawal and dam removal (Fig. 1). In the remaining 11
cases, the court allowed continued hydropower production,
contingent on meeting modern environmental conditions listed
in the verdict (Fig. 1). Ten of these are small-scale plants (<1.5
MW), and one is a regulation dam for downstream hydropower
(Tab. 1). All verdicts emphasize longitudinal connectivity and
ﬁsh passage, requiring downstream ﬁsh passage solutions; 10
of 11 also mandate improved upstream passage (Tab. 2, and see
“passage” subheading). Environmental ﬂow received less
attention, though most verdicts include minimum ﬂow
requirements through ﬁshways and some restrict hydropeaking
(Tab. 2, and see “ﬂow” subheading).
2.2 Downstream passage measures in the court
decisions
Guidance screens and associated bypasses are required at
nine of the 11 facilities (Tab. 2). Among the required guidance
screens, four are inclined (i.e., guiding the ﬁsh vertically
towards the water’s surface: alfa rack), one is angled (i.e.,
guiding the ﬁsh laterally towards one side of the river/channel:
beta rack), and four are undeﬁned (Tab. 2). Maximum angles
against the ﬂow are 30°(n=2), 35°(n=6), and 45°(n=1), while
maximum gap widths are deﬁned as 13 mm (n= 1), 15 mm
(n=2), or 18 mm (n=6 ) (Tab. 2). Bypass pipes leading ﬁsh
downstream are required together with the rack at all facilities
except at Fada, where eels are to be trapped in a traditional eel
trap (in Swedish: ålkista) and transported downstream past the
dam (transport of other species is not mentioned). One facility
requires an overlay plate for velocity refuge by the end of the
rack (Lingforsen). At one facility, the lack of such plate is
explained by low water velocity making it redundant (Ellenö).
For six facilities where guidance racks were required, bypass
discharge is deﬁned, ranging 30220 L s1. Based on turbine
capacity stated in the verdicts, this corresponds to a median of
5.2% (range =1.520%, n=6) of the maximum ﬂow through
the rack itself. Two facilities did not require guidance screens:
Kaserna and Kengis bruk. The facility Kaserna, being a
regulation dam, does not have a turbine but regulates ﬂow for
downstream hydropower plants and therefore the court
presumably assumes that ﬁsh will safely pass through the
only route available. At Kengis bruk, the dam does not cover
the full width of the river, and remedial measures to improve
downstream passage include reducing the width of a temporary
dam, closing the power plant for two weeks during peak
salmonid
smolt
migration
(closure
triggered
by
either
temperature increases or peak ﬂow), and running the power
plant with open sluice gates next to the turbine intake through
the bulk of the smolt run (other ﬁsh species are not mentioned).
2.3 Upstream passage measures in the court
decisions
At all facilities except Kengis bruk (where the dam does
not span the full river width), some type of upstream passage
solution is required (Tab. 2). This includes ﬁshways that allow
the entire ﬁsh community to pass, or at least a large part of it
(n=6), or eel ramps for juvenile eels (n=6) (Tab. 2). Two
verdicts require both an eel ramp and a technical ﬁshway (Tab.
2). Where only eel ramps are required, this is based on
assumptions that naturally this reach would only be passable
for eel.
Among the required ﬁshways, four are nature-like and two
are vertical slot ﬁshways, (Tab. 2). Slopes for nature-like
ﬁshways range from 1.2% to 4% (Tab. 2), while the vertical
slot ﬁshway has a maximum drop of 15 cm and a slope of
57%. Where speciﬁed (n=3), water discharge to the ﬁshways
range from 50 to 330 L s1 (Tab. 2), or 5% to 17% of the river’s
mean annual ﬂow (MQ). One of the eel ramps requires the
downstream bypass pipe to exit near the ramp to provide
additional attraction water.
The operation period is deﬁned for three ﬁshways and ﬁve
eel ramps. Fishways must function year-round, except for one

site where winter conditions (e.g., ice cover) exempt operation.
Eel ramps are mandated to operate from May (n=4) or June
(n=1), to end of September (n=2) or mid-October (n=3). For
three facilities (Lingforsen, Ellenö, and Stigen Västra),
operation periods may be adjusted in consultation with the
County Administrative Board (i.e., the supervisory authority).
For the facility Stigen Västra it is further speciﬁed that based
on climate change and/or new knowledge, operation period
adjustments may be needed. In addition, for three facilities
(Ellenö, Stigen Västra, Kaserna), it is speciﬁed for what eel
sizes the ramp shall function for (10–40 or 0–70 cm).
Fishway placement is detailed in some verdicts, while
others require the ﬁnal setup to be determined in consultation
with the County Administrative Board or a ﬁsh passage
specialist. At one facility (Lingforsen), a chain barrier is
prescribed to guide ﬁsh from the tailrace to the bypassed river
where the ﬁshway is located. At another facility (Husbykvarn),
an additional ﬁshway is required to connect the tailrace to the
area downstream the spillway, where the primary ﬁshway is
situated. At one site (Kärramölla), the power plant must shut
down one day per week from September to October to facilitate
upstream migration (attraction to the ﬁshway) of salmonid
spawners.
2.4 Flow and habitat measures in the court decisions
Hydropeaking (i.e., short term shifts in turbined discharge
to track electricity demands or prices, in Swedish: korttidsre-
glering) is explicitly prohibited in six verdicts, while two
verdicts mandate reduced rates of change in spilled or turbined
ﬂow without specifying thresholds. Despite most dams having
bypassed river reaches of different lengths, minimum ﬂow is
typically just a consequence of discharge in the ﬁsh passage
solutions. Mandated minimum ﬂow range from 5 to 610 L s1
(Tab. 2) or the river discharge. Mean annual ﬂow (MQ) and
mean low ﬂow (MLQ) are available in the verdict background
material for nine facilities. For these, the median environmen-
tal ﬂow constitutes 10% (range: 317%) of the mean MQ, or
100% (range: 50131%) of MLQ. Dynamic or adaptive
environmental ﬂows are not mentioned in any verdicts.
Downstream habitat restoration to facilitate ﬁsh movement is
required in three cases (Lingforsen, Kärramölla, and Ellenö).
No other habitat measures are mentioned in any verdicts.
2.5 Monitoring in the court decisions
Monitoring requirements in the court verdicts for actions
implemented to fulﬁl modern environmental conditions are
limited. For most facilities, monitoring requirements only
concern registration of water discharge, or conﬁrming water
discharge in ﬁsh passage solutions. Evaluation of the function
of remedial measures is only required in a few verdicts (Fada,
Skeppsta, Kaserna, and Kärramölla). At the facility Fada, the
functionality of up- and downstream passage facilities should
be conﬁrmed using the best available monitoring technique
during the ﬁrst 3 yr post-implementation. This verdict also
allows adjustment if conservation status targets (in Swedish:
bevarandestatus)
or
environmental
quality
standards
(in Swedish: miljökvalitetsnorm) are not met in accordance
with relevant legislation (i.e., the implementation of the EU
Habitats directive (92/43/EEC) and Water Framework direc-
tive (2000/60/EC) in the Swedish Environmental Code). At the
facility Skeppsta, a statement of functionality from an expert is
required, but the basis for the statement is not deﬁned. At the
facility Kaserna (the regulation dam), evaluation of the
functionality of the ﬁsh passage solution is also required, again
without specifying what the evaluation should contain. For the
facility Kärramölla, the regulatory authority should advise on
the evaluation of passage solutions. Regarding eel ramps,
monitoring is only mentioned for one facility (Lingforsen)

where the eel ladder should be checked weekly, no additional
information is given in the verdict.
2.6 Withdrawal of permit and dam removals in the
court decisions
Of the 33 retrials completed so far, 22 led to dam removal
(Tab. 3). These cases fall outside of the main scope of this
study. Monitoring post-removal-effects is however important
to understand ecosystem responses, and we therefore present
data on dam removals in short. Seven facilities were small
scale (effect below 1.5 MW), which is within the same range as
those that were granted permission for continued hydropower
production (Tab. 1), and the remaining 15 were listed as having
“unknown” effect (some of which were dams, not hydropower
plants) (Tab. 3). One dam could not be found in the ﬁeld, not
even remains of it, (Damm vid Småvatten M 580-22, Tab. 3).
All verdicts list some form of restorative and/or habitat
enhancing measures.
3 Discussion
Since the start of the retrials within the National Plan for
Modern Environmental Conditions for Hydropower in 2022 to
the ﬁrst pause in 2023, a total of 33 cases have been completed
(until the end of 2024, counting decisions that cannot be
overruled). Of these, 11 facilities were granted continued
hydropower production, conditional on fulﬁlling modern
environmental conditions. The remaining 22 cases resulted
in permit withdrawal and dam removal. All verdicts focus on
longitudinal connectivity and ﬁsh passage and are based on
present species distribution and environmental conditions.
When mentioned, monitoring requirements focus mainly on
abiotic factors (e.g., ﬂow in ﬁshway), with only a few verdicts
formulating requirements based on function or ecological
effects of remedial measures.
3.1 Downstream passage and guidelines
Given the historical relative absence of downstream
passage solutions in Swedish rivers (Calles et al., 2013), it
is encouraging that most verdicts include speciﬁc protection
and guidance systems to allow downstream passage of ﬁsh.
Nine verdicts require low sloping racks with small gap-widths
to hinder ﬁsh from passing through turbines and guide them to
a safe route. Versions of such solutions have proven effective
for eel (Calles et al., 2021; Tomanova et al., 2023) and juvenile
and adult salmon (Nyqvist et al., 2017, 2018; Tomanova et al.,
2021). Gap width (Harbicht et al., 2022) and angle (Albayrak
et al., 2020) are important characteristics to the guidance rack
function. In the assessed verdicts, gap-widths and sloping
angle ranged between 1318 mm 3045°, respectively. Calles
et al. (2013) deﬁnes best available technique as gap-widths of
1013 mm and angles 30°, but the authors do not exclude
good performance at slightly larger gap-widths and greater
angles. Indeed, good guidance has been reported for gap
widths of 1520 mm, and angles of 26-30 (Calles et al., 2021;
Tomanova et al., 2023). Guidance performance also depends
on features like overlay plates and bypass entrance design
(Albayrak et al., 2020), which at times can result in low

hydropeaking (No peaking), and requirements to change turbine discharge at a slow rate (Reduced rate). Missing information in the court decisions is denoted not provided (NP). Note that
Kaserna is a regulation dam and not a hydropower facility (hence, water ﬂow and effect are not applicable (NA) at this site.

guidance performance (de Bie et al., 2018). Also, ﬁsh sizes up
to 20-times the gap-width can pass through these racks (Knott
et al., 2023), however, this likely varies between species due to
differences in body shape. Therefore, given the technical
speciﬁcations deﬁned in the verdicts, good guidance perfor-
mance is possible but should not be assumed for all species of
ﬁsh.
3.2 Upstream passage vs. guidelines
Upstream passage solutions adapted for the entire ﬁsh
community are only required at sites that allowed natural
passage historically. Described slopes in the verdicts align with
some guidelines (FAO/DVWK, 2002; SwAM, 2020) but
partially breach recommendations in others (Calles et al.,
2013; Schmutz and Mielach, 2013). Importantly, ﬁsh passage
success is the product of multiple steps as the ﬁsh must
approach, enter, pass through, and exit the ﬁshway (Castro-
Santos et al., 2009). While slope-recommendations focus on
ensuring that the ﬁsh can pass through the ﬁshway, the
attraction (i.e., ﬁnding and entering the ﬁshway) is typically an
important source of failure (Bunt et al., 2012). Attraction
efﬁciency depends on water discharge proportion and entrance
placement, and positions close to the barrier and main ﬂow, and
discharges of at least 5%, is recommended for small rivers
(Calles et al., 2013). Placement is typically considered in the
verdicts, and for the three facilities where ﬁshway discharge
and mean annual discharge of the river was available,
proportions ranged from 1–10%, aligning somewhat with
the guidelines. The ideal ﬁshway position, however, depends
on discharge composition. For example, a ﬁshway may have
high attraction when most water is turbined, and low attraction
when much water is spilled, or vice versa, depending on where
the ﬁshway is positioned in relation to the hydropower plant
(Hagelin et al., 2019). Interestingly, one verdict mandates a
chain guidance barrier to guide ﬁsh towards the ﬁshway. While
potentially useful, the scientiﬁc knowledge on physical
guidance for upstream migrating ﬁsh remains poor (Benitez
et al., 2025). Overall, as placement and water allocation often
conﬂict with electricity production, obtaining good passage
conditions typically require data on functionality followed by
adaptive designs (Nyqvist et al., 2017).
Due to natural barriers such as waterfalls, some locations
are considered naturally passable only by juvenile eels, and
hence only requiring an eel ramp. Importantly, eel ramps – as
most upstream passage solutions – are only designed to aid
upstream migration, not downstream migration, and hence
constitute a one-way migration solution that needs to be
accompanied by downstream passage solutions. Placement is
important for the performance of the eel ramp, as well as the
design, including longitudinal and lateral slope, climbing
substrate, conveyance ﬂow, ﬂow direction, and crest shape
(Fjeldstad et al., 2018). Concerns have been raised that many
eel ramps may function poorly (e.g., Watz et al., 2019;
Williamson et al., 2025). Very few verdicts specify design or
placement, except the facility Fada, where the eel ramp should
be 300 mm wide, and the facility Stigen Västra, where the
ramp substrate should work for ﬁsh of many sizes (however,
without specifying type of substrate). Monitoring of the eel
ramp functionality is generally lacking. It is also worrying that
the operation period varies (when deﬁned, speciﬁed to start in
May or June, and last until end of September or mid-October),
since no reasoning is provided. In Sweden, eel migrate
upstream outside the periods speciﬁed in the verdicts. For

example, glass eel are trapped in the cooling water intake at the
Ringhals nuclear power plant already by January/February
(Westerberg and Wickström, 2016; Jaktén Langert et al., 2025)
and migrate upstream in the nearby river Viskan throughout
October (Sjöholm and Käll, 2024). Functioning eel ramps are
crucial not only for river connectivity but also for monitoring
of recruitment (ICES WGEEL, 2024). Notably, the longest
European eel recruitment series (1900–2017) comes from such
monitoring at the Olidan facility in the river Göta älv (ICES
WGEEL,
2024;
unfortunately,
the
data
collection
was
discontinued in 2018). Only one verdict requires regular
checks of the eel ramp (Lingforsen), but no information is
given on what the checks imply, or if data on eel counts should
be collected. To ensure the function of eel ramps and data
collection on recruitment, guidelines, monitoring, and an
adaptive approach regarding operation period, placement, and
design, will be needed in future verdicts.
3.3 Flow, habitat, and other impacts
All facilities receiving verdicts of modern environmental
conditions are small run-of-the-river hydropower plants with
very limited water storage capacity. This likely explains the
strong focus on passage solutions and the relative omission of
habitat and ﬂow related measures, with these restricted to
ﬁshway ﬂows, prohibition against hydropeaking or restricted
rates of change of turbine discharge. Nevertheless, several of
the dams have bypassed river reaches that are most likely
degraded (compared to their original lotic state) by water
abstraction for hydropower production (Poff et al., 2010;
Kiernan et al., 2012). Despite this, environmental ﬂows are
only a consequence of ﬂow through the ﬁshway (i.e., there’s no
additional environmental ﬂow requirements), and habitat
concerns in bypassed stretches are largely restricted to
downstream passability. Importantly, hydropower mitigation
is related to broader ecological functions beyond passage (He
et al., 2024), even if impacts on ﬁsh passage often dominate
media and stakeholder attention. Given the high frequency of
damming, and hence the lack of lotic river reaches, ignoring
ﬂow and habitat effects may be an opportunity lost for Swedish
rivers (Göthe et al., 2019; Widén et al., 2022a, c; 2023).
The narrow focus on ﬁsh passage solutions in the verdicts
also implies that other environmental impacts are largely
overlooked. For example, few non-ﬁsh related measures are
mentioned. While nature-like ﬁshways can facilitate passage for
other animals (e.g., invertebrates: Streib et al., 2020), the same is
not true for eel ramps. Moreover, ﬂow conditions unrelated to
passage, and issues like temperature and gas supersaturation are
ignored(Poffetal.,2010;Zaideletal.,2021;Lietal.,2022).Asa
result,evenwithmodernenvironmentalconditions,downstream
habitats and non-ﬁsh species (e.g., birds, semi-aquatic animals,
and riparian plants) may remain as impacted as before (e.g.,
Nilsson et al., 1997; He et al., 2024; Altanov et al., 2025). Even
though the re-licensed facilities are relatively small dams and
short bypassed river reaches, at national scale this oversight may
havesigniﬁcantimplicationsforecosystemvaluesatrisk.Thisis
particularly relevant in Sweden, where the absolute majority of
hydropower facilities are small (approximately 1900 plants
contribute 6% to the total Swedish hydroelectricity, including
approximately 1030 micro-powerplants with effects under 125
kW, Lindblom and Holmgren, 2016). Only 208 power plants
have an effect over 10 MW, contributing approximately 94% of
the Swedish hydroelectricity (Lindblom and Holmgren, 2016).
3.4 Lack of monitoring requirements
Ensuring proper function of passage solutions is important
given the inherent compromise between energy production and
function, which means that there are many different passage
solution designs (Noonan et al., 2012; Bunt et al., 2012). Even if
ﬁsh are able to pass through the ﬁshway it may still perform
poorly due to issues with attraction, entrance, or conditions after
passage (Nyqvist et al., 2016; Hagelin et al., 2019). Hence,
bypasses can become mortality traps instead of safe passage
routes (Nyqvist et al., 2016), and even functioning ﬁshways can
cause delays due to low attraction efﬁciency (Hagelin et al.,
2019).Itisthereforeworryingthatmostcourtverdictsglossover
post-construction monitoring, with only three explicitly requir-
ing some evaluation of function. Additionally, the empirical
evidence for many mitigation measures is relatively vague,
making detailed design requirements without corresponding
functionality requirements, problematic (Rogosch et al., 2024).
Monitoring, evaluation, and adaptation are key for successful
restoration in general, particularly for ﬁsh passage solutions
(Rogosch et al., 2024). Some verdicts allow adaptive passage
solution adjustments if conservation status targets or environ-
mental quality standards are not met. This is, in general, a sound
approach that inevitably relies on monitoring. When monitoring
isrequired,itisimportanttoconsiderthatenvironmentalindices,
used in e.g., ecological status assessment, are indicative, not
deﬁnitive,withrespecttoecologicalstatusassessment,andcarry
substantial uncertainties and in some cases ﬂaws (Löfgren et al.,
2009;Näslundetal.,2022).Hence,well-formulatedspeciﬁcand
relevant monitoring objectives are necessary for proper
evaluations.
The hydropower facilities that have completed re-licensing
so far are small, making substantial monitoring appear costly
relative to production values. Instead of being a potential
argument against monitoring and evaluation, however, this can
be seen as an incitement for an industry-wide approach:
coordinated monitoring across sites could be more productive
than isolated efforts. For example, studying ﬁsh passage
efﬁciency and environmental ﬂows at multiple locations could
inform on what works under speciﬁc conditions (Weber et al.,
2018; Nyqvist et al., 2025). Such an approach would evaluate
speciﬁc mitigation effort types while also expanding our
knowledge on mitigation solutions in general. Results could
suggest adaptations for existing solutions and inform future
court processes. Similarly, technical validation could also be
coordinated, ensuring that the implemented measures follow
standardsandguidelines.Validationdocuments couldbeshared,
and the joint level of ambition could thereby increase. Requiring
functionality, maintenance of installations, and monitoring
appears fundamental for a successful re-licensing process, and
its’s omission a lost opportunity to the detriment of our rivers.
3.5 Dam removals – opportunities from a wider
management perspective
Of the 33 retrials, 22 led to permit withdrawals and dam
removals, typically at the owner’s request. Given that dam

removal eliminates environmental issues related to longitudi-
nal
connectivity
and
natural
ﬂow
dynamics
(provided
sufﬁcient post-removal river channel restoration), this is
encouraging from a river ecology perspective. It is also
noteworthy that dam removals present an opportunity to
contribute to the 25000 km of free-ﬂowing river sections
mandated (at the EU-wide level) by the recently implemented
EU Nature Restoration Regulation (EU, 2024/1991). This,
however, requires consideration of additional environmental
measures in terms of restoring lateral river connectivity in
reaches up- and downstream of the removed dam, likely by
other actors than the dam owners. Synchronized planning and a
holistic approach at larger spatial scales could beneﬁt river and
riparian ecosystems and create synergistic positive effects on
ecosystems (Stoffers et al., 2024). Taking the opportunity to
monitor ecological effects of the dam removals, from a central
agency perspective, could also inform future restoration and
hydropower mitigation projects, including insights on ecosys-
tem recovery rates.
4 Conclusion
We conclude that while ﬁshways (and/or eel ramps) are
covered in most verdicts where continued hydropower
production was granted, the focus on a few design components
rather than actual functionality risks poor passage efﬁciency.
The lack of monitoring requirements means that even if
passage efﬁciency is high, or
vice versa,
it will be
undocumented. We propose that ﬁshways should enable
passage for the entire ﬁsh community, which typically requires
site speciﬁc adaptive design and monitoring of functionality
(Nyqvist et al., 2017; Silva et al., 2018). For eel ramps,
guidelines on placement, design, and monitoring should be
followed (e.g., Fjeldstad et al., 2018; Watz et al., 2019;
Williamson et al., 2025), the operation period should cover the
entire migration period (Westerberg and Wickström, 2016;
Sjöholm and Käll, 2024; Jaktén Langert et al., 2025), and a
downstream passage solution needs to be combined with the
eel ramp. Beyond passage, other parameters should be
covered, inducing but not limited to habitat restoration,
ensuring ﬂow and avoiding dry stretches, avoidance of
temperature effects and gas supersaturation, and inclusion
of non-ﬁsh organisms (e.g., Nilsson et al., 1997; Zaidel et al.,
2021; He et al., 2024; Altanov et al., 2025). We emphasize that
resulting dam removals represent an unprecedented chance to
further improve ecological integrity in our waters, as well as
contributing to the mandated goals within the recently
implemented EU Nature Restoration Regulation (EU, 2024/
1991). At the current retrial speed however, there is a risk that
the goal of processing all hydropower facilities within 20 yr
will not be reached, implying prolonged ecological risk to the
riverine ecosystems (Nyqvist et al., 2025). The nation-wide
Swedish retrial process does nonetheless provide a unique
opportunity to implement measures and monitoring to improve
not only connectivity, but the whole riverine ecosystem, and
early cases can serve as case studies for implementation of
mitigation measures in other hydropower-regulated rivers.
